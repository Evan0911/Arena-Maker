# Arena Maker
Arena Maker (project name) is a Unity based video game project.
The concept of the game is to control a character in an arena that can have several features, like traps or pits, that can change throughout a mission, with upgrades, like more space in the arena, that can buy in a shop.

This project is on hold (and mostly abandonned) since several years.
